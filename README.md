Work in Progress
==========

This is the upcoming (3.0) version of YaleMobile. It is work in progress!

## The Modules

Most interesting (i.e. reusable) modules of the app should be LaundryView and TransLoc integration. More on that later...

## The License

YaleMobile is licensed under GPLv2 license. The components of this application are mostly useful for other universities like Yale, and we would hope that our peers can open source their software as well.

## The Credits

YaleMobile 3 is currently under construction by [Hengchu Zhang](https://github.com/hengchu) (CC '15, development) and [Danqing Liu](https://github.com/ik) (CC '13, advisory & design). It is supported by [Yale Student Technology Collaborative](https://github.com/yalestc), which also supports several other open source software.

YaleMobile 3 is powered by [AFNetworking 2](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking), [ECSlidingViewController 2](https://github.com/ECSlidingViewController/ECSlidingViewController), and [Mantle](https://github.com/MantleFramework/Mantle).

YaleMobile started as a personal project of Danqing in 2012 and has undergone two major versions. The second version of the application, designed for iOS 6.x, is also open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/ik/yalemobile-old). Many Yalies contributed to the project along the way, and you can see the full list in its Credit page.

YaleMobile 1 & 2 was powered by ASIHTTPRequest, AFNetworking (v1), ECSlidingViewController (v1), Hpple and MBProgressHUD libraries.

All versions of YaleMobile contains data from Yale University, MacGray Corp. and TransL≈çc. Please note their respective licenses and copyrights when reusing or modifying YaleMobile.
